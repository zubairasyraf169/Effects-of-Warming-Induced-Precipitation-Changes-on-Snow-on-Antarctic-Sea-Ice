# Effects-of-Warming-Induced-Precipitation-Changes-on-Snow-on-Antarctic-Sea-Ice

Antarctic sea ice significantly influences global climate through its impact on planetary albedo, ocean circulation, and atmospheric dynamics. The interaction between sea ice and overlying snow critically affects sea ice thermodynamics and mass balance, yet the response of snow-sea ice systems to future atmospheric warming and changes in precipitation patterns remains uncertain. This sensitivity study systematically explores how atmospheric warming scenarios, characterized by incremental temperature increases and the transition in precipitation from snowfall to rainfall, influence snow properties on Antarctic sea ice. Using the one-dimensional SNOWPACK model, simulations are initialized with observational snow buoy data from the Weddell Sea and meteorological inputs derived from ERA5 reanalysis. The study assesses temporal changes in snow density, stratigraphy, and thermal conductivity under different warming scenarios. By comparing scenarios with controlled variations in temperature and precipitation, this research provides valuable insights into snowpack evolution, enhancing Antarctic sea ice modeling and improving predictive capabilities under climate change.
